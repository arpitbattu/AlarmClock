# AlarmClock


Alarm Clock Application have been on a growing trend with people becoming more interested in their sleep
patterns and ways to force themselves up. There are millions of applications on Google’s Play Store that have a
plethora of features such as sleep tracking abilities, challenges to turn off alarm, custom alarm tones/music and
much more. Our Android mobile application focuses on what happens before the alarm goes off in the morning.
Our focus is to bring something new and exciting like bringing a “smart” alarm that suggest a waking up time
based on the person’s inputs.


This project challenges us to create a mobile application that is useful for the everyday busy college
student. As college students, we are overwhelmed by the loads of assignments, our work schedules
and other activities. We spend restless nights and setting alarms according to the next day’s schedule
is the last thing that we want to do. Therefore, this application will maximize our sleep time and relax
our busy minds. It's important to create an app where it sets what time to wake up based on factors
such as the time to get ready and commute time. The end goal is for the user to input the time they
need to be at the designated location and then the app will calculate the rest to set an accurate alarm
time. You won’t need to spend extra time thinking about what time to set the alarm to wake up to. All
you will have to worry about is getting a good night sleep, which overall improves the productivity of
college students.

Our primary platform that we use to code was Android Studio. We use an Google Pixel 2 phone emulator to run
the code and see the output. We coded with Java.
